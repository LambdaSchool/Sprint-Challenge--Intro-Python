# We have a collection of US cities with population over 750,000 stored in the
# file "cities.csv". (CSV stands for "comma-separated values".)
#
# Use Python's built-in "csv" module to read this file so that each record is
# imported into a City instance. (You're free to add more attributes to the City
# class if you wish, but this is not necessary.) Google "python 3 csv" for
# references and use your Google-fu for other examples.
#
# Store the instances in the "cities" list, below.
#
# Note that the first line of the CSV is header that describes the fields--this
# should not be loaded into a City object.

# Allow the user to input two points, each specified by latitude and longitude.
# These points form the corners of a lat/lon square. Output the cities that fall
# within this square.
#
# Be aware that the user could specify either a lower-left/upper-right pair of
# coordinates, or an upper-left/lower-right pair of coordinates. Hint: normalize
# the input data so that it's always one or the other, then search for cities.
#
# Example I/O:
#
# Enter lat1,lon1: 45,-100
# Enter lat2,lon2: 32,-120
# Albuquerque: (35.1055,-106.6476)
# Riverside: (33.9382,-117.3949)
# San Diego: (32.8312,-117.1225)
# Los Angeles: (34.114,-118.4068)
# Las Vegas: (36.2288,-115.2603)
# Denver: (39.7621,-104.8759)
