# We have a collection of US cities with population over 750,000 stored in the
# file "cities.csv". (CSV stands for "comma-separated values".)
#
# In the body of the `cityreader` function, use Python's built-in "csv" module 
# to read this file so that each record is imported into a City instance. Then
# return the list with all the City instances from the function.
# Google "python 3 csv" for references and use your Google-fu for other examples.
#
# Store the instances in the "cities" list, below.
#
# Note that the first line of the CSV is header that describes the fields--this
# should not be loaded into a City object.
